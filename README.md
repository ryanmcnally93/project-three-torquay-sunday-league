# Torquay Sunday League


<!--Image on all devices-->

This is a Sunday league football website, for a league based in Torquay. Languages include; HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. This application was created using Flask, Postgres and SQLAlchemy, and originally deployed on Heroku using ElephantSQL.

The season is about to begin in sunny Torquay but we have one more space open for a team to take part in the twelve teamed league. The user has the ability to register and upload their teams details for submission to the league.

They can create, read, update and delete any information and the same is set for their player information too. Anyone can see the team and player information whether logged in or not so they know who is taking part in the upcoming league.
